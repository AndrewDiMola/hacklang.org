# What is Hack?

Hack is a programming language for [HHVM](http://hhvm.com/). Hack reconciles the fast development cycle of a dynamically typed language with the discipline provided by static typing, while adding many features commonly found in other modern programming languages.

Hack provides instantaneous type checking by incrementally checking your files as you edit them. It typically runs in less than 200 milliseconds, making it easy to integrate into your development workflow without introducing a noticeable delay.

The following are some of the important language features of Hack. For more information, see the [full documentation](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/), or follow through the quick [interactive tutorial](http://hacklang.org/tutorial).

Other significant features of Hack include [XHP](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/XHP/introduction), [Shapes](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/shapes/introduction), [Type Aliasing](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/type-aliases/introduction), [Async](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/async/introduction) support, backwards compatibility with PHP code, and [much more](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/).

We are delighted to have open-sourced both Hack and [conversion tools](http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/tools/introduction) you can use on your own codebase. We are dedicated to continuing to work on this project: we would love to have your feedback on our work so far, and welcome you all to participate in the HHVM and Hack communities.
